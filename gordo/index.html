      <h2 id="sample">Easy Chicken Bake</h2>

      <p>Baked Chicken makes a great dinner option for busy nights because:
<ul>
<li>It’s easy</li>
<li>You can make it all in one dish</li>
<li>It cooks without babysitting so you can get other stuff done!</li>
<li>The problem is that sometimes it is bland, boring, and even can be tough or chewy.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>It is packed with flavor, baking right in a rich and creamy sauce. The best part is that not only is it delicious, but it can go from the fridge to the oven in as little as 10 minutes!

<br><strong>Easy and delicious!</strong></p>

      <p>This Million Dollar Chicken Bake is <q>rescuing</q> chicken breast destined for boring chewy baking everywhere! If you have ever had Million Dollar dip, you know what I am talking about. If not, you are in for a treat.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <p>The ingredients are simple and straight forward here, and most are common, everyday fridge/pantry ingredients.
<ul>
<li>Chicken breast- Try to use thin chicken breast, or cut them in half (butterfly) or pound them out. Thin chicken breasts will cook more quickly and evenly, as well as, stay more tender!</li>
<li>Cream cheese- Make sure it is softened so everything will combine well.</li>
<li>Colby Jack</li>
<li>Mayonnaise</li>
<li>Bacon- You can make this ahead of time and store it in the fridge or freezer, or buy precooked bacon. I like to heat it in the microwave or skillet once am ready to use it to get it nice and crispy, fresh again.
<li>Green Onions</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>Substitutions</h4>
<p><ul>
    <li>Chicken- You can substitute boneless, skinless chicken thighs or tenderloins for chicken breast</li>
<li>Cream Cheese- Light cream cheese can be used</li>
<li>Colby Jack- You can use cheddar or mexican blend if needed.</li>
</ul></p>
      <h2>What to Serve with Baked Chicken</h2>
      <p>This dish is packed with flavor and pretty rich in its own right so I like to pair it with side dishes that are lighter generally. Of course it goes well with all of the classics, but also pairs well with healthy favorites.
