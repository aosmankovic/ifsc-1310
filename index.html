      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation are both ways to build a websote, but they do it in a different way. Graceful degradation is kinda like building something from top to bottom, while progressive enhancement is the other way around. 
      Progressive enhancement starts from building a basic html page with the concept ofTh the page and then adds adding layers to make it look pretty. Building a website this way makes sure that the main concept of the page is awlays supported, no matter on what browser or device a user is using. It is also a good way to check your work along the way and make sure it works properly before going to the next step. But as one of the articles mentioned, if you already have a website and you're just trying to make it more accessible, graceful degradation would be a better way to do it, rather than making a brand new website from scratch. </p>
