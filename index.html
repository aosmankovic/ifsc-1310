  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection Assignment</h2>
  <p>My first draft wasn't that great, so the first thing I did before showing it to a friend and getting feedback was making it look somewhat good. First, I fixed the navigation bar and put it at the top of the page, as well as fixing the title of the page. Then, I asked my roommates what they thought about the page, but they weren't much help. The only thing they said was missing was images to "make it look more fun", so I put some images on the homepage using java script. Besides that, I kinda had to rely on myself and act as if I was using the website. </p>
  <p>I added hover transitions over home, page, faq and contact elements, and also over the questions in faq section. I also added some articles in the history section and again added hover effect. If I were to start over the project, I would definitely take your advice and make a plan on how I want the website to look like.</p>
  <p>In general, I really enjoyed this class and I learned a lot. To be honest, I was confused most the time with theory and terminology, but writing the code in class helped me understand the concepts and how it works.</p>
  
      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation are both ways to build a websote, but they do it in a different way. Graceful degradation is kinda like building something from top to bottom, while progressive enhancement is the other way around. 
      Progressive enhancement starts from building a basic html page with the concept ofTh the page and then adds adding layers to make it look pretty. Building a website this way makes sure that the main concept of the page is awlays supported, no matter on what browser or device a user is using. It is also a good way to check your work along the way and make sure it works properly before going to the next step. But as one of the articles mentioned, if you already have a website and you're just trying to make it more accessible, graceful degradation would be a better way to do it, rather than making a brand new website from scratch. </p>
